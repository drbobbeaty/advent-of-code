# Advent of Code

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/drbobbeaty/advent-of-code)](https://repl.it/github/drbobbeaty/advent-of-code)

Just my solutions to the problems at [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com),
which a [friend](https://github.com/hby/) introduced me to in 2015. It has been
a fun way to push the usage of Clojure to stateful, and more traditionally
mutable domain problems.

## 2015

This was my first year and I made it all the way to Day 21 - it was a lot of
fun to do some of these days. And I have to admit that Clojure was just a great
tool to get a lot of these puzzles done.

## 2016

This year I was a little _busier_ and I only got to Day 8 - and I know it was
just that I _wanted_ to do it, but a lot of the puzzles had state in them, and
that wasn't a great fit for Clojure. But it was still fun to work these with
a friend.

I ended up finishing up a lot of this year while doing 2018, so a lot more
of this is filled in. Good enough. :)

## 2017

This I didn't really get started on, and I feel kinda bad about that. But I'm
hoping to take some time and really see if I can do a few of these while I'm
also working on this year's puzzles.

Looking pretty good - up to Day 20, and I'll keep working on these as I have
time.

Finished all 25 days! This was a really impressive run for me - didn't have
to skip a day - just one to the next, and then on we go. Not bad. :)

## 2018

I got more done this year than I expected. I didn't get three pathing problems
done, and I have looked at the solutions for some, and they make no sense, so
I think I'm going to have to figure this out by reading and working on a few
ideas. But still... this is a lot better than I've done in the past.

## 2019

I got stuck on Day 18 and Day 20 - bother because of computational complexity.
Both were pathing problems, and I really had to buck up and learn Dijkstra's as
well as the Breadth-First Search that does things differently, but can be used
to find distances in mazes, etc. I'm glad I pushed through and learned these
two concepts by beating on them - I'm a better coder because of it.

The other days were not too bad, and while it took a few extra days to get
Day 18 and Day 20, it was *_really_* worth it.
